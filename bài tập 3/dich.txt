Hello, Iâ€™m Minh. I am studying at Hong Bang Secondary School. Located in a bustling city, it has been serving the community for many years. At Hong Bang Secondary School, we not only provide academic training but also promote the personal and social development of students. Furthermore, I also have the opportunity to participate in many interesting extracurricular activities, clubs and sports teams. Thanks to these group activities, I was able to meet many new friends. We always help each other when there are problems, we also often go out together to fun places. The teachers at my school are very enthusiastic, always ready to help students when they encounter difficulties in learning as well as in life. I think Hong Bang Secondary School is a good solution for us to study. I will definitely always remember the beautiful memories of school when I leave it.
